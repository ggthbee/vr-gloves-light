This is a VR Glove with native steamvr tracking.

It was designed to create the utmost flexbility, while keeping it cheap, repairable in mind and ease of use.

While i am sadly only a designer, i have not that much time (or money) to continue i will lay you out a basic template of making your own one.

While the design is finished, with schematics and layout however i have no big knowledge of programming or firmware embeddment.
i hope you can help grow this librabry so we can both finish this project!
